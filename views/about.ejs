      <p>Hi there! I'm Chloe Hoang, an 18-year-old undergraduate at Ontario Tech University, where I'm
            specializing in Networking and IT Security. My fascination with technology drives me to explore
            the complexities of cybersecurity and digital infrastructure, aiming to pave the way for a safer
            online world. When I'm not immersed in my studies, you'll find me on the badminton court, representing
            Canada as an international player. Balancing my love for sports and technology keeps my life dynamic
            and fulfilling. </p>
